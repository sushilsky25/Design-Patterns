In C#, an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated. Instead, it serves as a base class for other classes to inherit from. Abstract classes are used to define a common set of behaviors or properties that derived classes should have.

To create an abstract class in C#, you use the “abstract” keyword before the class definition.

Abstraction in C# is the process to hide the internal details and show only the functionality. The abstract modifier indicates the incomplete implementation. The keyword abstract is used before the class or method to declare the class or method as abstract. Also, the abstract modifier can be used with indexers, events, and properties.
